- ORMs / ODMs (sequalize, mongoose)
- Zod - Input Validation
- Monorepo / Turborepo
- Serverless Backends
- API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Autogenerated clients
- Authentication using external libraries
- Scaling Node.js, performance benchmarks
- Deploying npm packages
- Containerization, Docker
- Deploying to AWS servers

## Git Branching Strategy
Gitflow is a popular branching strategy that uses two main branches: master and develop.

The `master` branch contains production-ready code, while the `develop` branch contains the latest development code. `Feature` branches are created off the `develop` branch, and when the `feature` is complete, it is merged back into the `develop` branch. When the `develop` branch is ready for release, it is merged into the `master` branch, and a new release is created.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local installation or cloud instance)
- A package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/easycommerce.git
   cd easycommerce
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or if using yarn
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Setup enviroment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables
   ```bash
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI='replace-with-your-mongodb-uri'
   JWT_SECRET_KEY='replace-with-your-jwt-secret-key'
   ```
4. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or you can use yarn
    yarn run dev
    ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

  ### Usage

  - Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:3000` to explore and interact with the API endpoints.
  - Use tools like `Postman` to test API endpoints during development.
